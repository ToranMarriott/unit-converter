# Unit Converter

A unit converter built as a Chrome extension to practice clean JavaScript logic, input validation, and dynamic UI updates.

## Features
- Convert between common units (e.g., length/weight/temperature)
- Instant results
- Input validation and helpful UI feedback

## Tech
- JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- Chrome Extension APIs (manifest + extension UI)

## What I learned
- Structuring conversion logic for readability and reuse
- Handling user input edge cases (empty, NaN, negative values where relevant)
- Updating the DOM based on state and user actions

## Next improvements
- Add more unit categories
- Improve accessibility (keyboard flow, labels, focus states)
- Add simple tests for conversion functions
